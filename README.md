Code IDE Editors: Shortcomings, Improvement Opportunities, and Critical Issues

This repository documents a critical missing layer in modern AI-assisted code editors.

AI tools are powerful, but their behavior is often:
- unpredictable
- token-inefficient
- inconsistent across sessions
- hidden behind prompts and configs

This project highlights a core problem:

> **AI behavior is not a prompt problem.  
> It is a system and UX problem.**

The goal of this repository is to:
- make the problem visible
- describe it clearly
- propose simple, open standards that anyone can use today

This is not a tool.
This is not a framework.

This is documentation of a missing standard.

# AI-Assisted Development Manifesto

Modern code editors integrate AI,
but fail to provide a visible and persistent way
to control AI behavior at the project level.

AI should not guess how to behave.
AI should not infer intent from scattered prompts.
AI should not reset its behavior every session.

AI behavior must be:
- explicit
- visible
- project-scoped
- repeatable

Rules are not prompts.
Rules are contracts.

Until IDEs provide first-class support for this,
projects must define AI behavior themselves.

This is not a workaround.
This is a missing UX layer.

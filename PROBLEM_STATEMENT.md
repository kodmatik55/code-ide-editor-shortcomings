# Problem Statement

Most AI-assisted IDEs lack a visible and persistent layer
for defining AI behavior at the project level.

Current behavior:
- Rules are hidden in configs
- Behavior resets between sessions
- Users repeat the same instructions
- Large projects suffer from uncontrolled scanning
- Errors are attributed to "bad prompts"

This leads to:
- wasted tokens
- unpredictable edits
- user frustration
- loss of trust in AI tools

This is not a model limitation.
This is not a user error.

This is a product design gap.

# Why This Matters

AI-assisted development is becoming the default.

Without clear behavior control:
- small projects become noisy
- large projects become dangerous
- professional workflows break down

We already solved similar problems before:
- .editorconfig
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

AI behavior deserves the same visibility and standardization.

This is about safety, clarity, and trust.
